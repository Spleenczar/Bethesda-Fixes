# Bethesda-Error-Tracker
A repository for tracking all bugs and inconsistencies in Bethesda's main games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield), and mods that fix them.

The goal of this project is to push the games as close as possible to Bethesda's vision through the work of the modding community. The intent is to encourage modifications that "objectively" correct issues in the game. There is always going to be some degree of subjectivity with mods, but the idea is to heavily lean towards a "purist" vision of the games. Mods that alter gameplay the least to achieve a fix are preferred (as altering a line or two of random dialogue is a smaller change than altering a game mechanic or feature).

Additionally, all issues should only apply to the final or latest version of the game. Issues that no longer apply to the latest release should not be submitted.

See this issue https://github.com/Spleenczar/Bethesda-Fixes/issues/1 for an example of how to report one.

Please include the game and issue type in the title of the issue! It will help with labeling and searches.

## Types of Issues to Report
### Bugs
Bugs are glitches and issues where the game does not act as it normally does without good reason. Bugs are only tracked if there is enough evidence that they are actually unintended "features".
### Inconsistencies
Inconsistencies are issues where two objectively-stated facts in the game are incompatible. This does not include gameplay omissions (e.g. *x* creature is said to inhabit *y* area of the game world, but does not actually exist in the game) or facts that come from potentially unreliable sources. If the game does not directly contradict itself, it is not tracked in this project.
### Retcons
Retcons are inconsistencies between older and newer games in the series. This project assumes that older information is more accurate, and only tracks mods that rectify the newer game's information.

## Starfield
If the bug is for Starfield, report it to Bethesda first, but still feel free to add it to the tracker. I'll mark it fixed if it's confirmed to be fixed in a patch down the line.
